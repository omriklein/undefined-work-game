# The Game - Full Description

 
## The concept:
A platformer game where you need to go back to previous levels to get thing that helps you in the current level.

## Basic Levels
0. Introduction level. Basic platformer without any items. There will be an opened door that you need to pass in order to finish the level.
1. Simple platforms level without enemies.
The level will have a green key and a green door.
You need to get the green key to open the green door.
After the green door is opened, you go throw that door to complete the level.
2. Same as the previous level, but we include enemies that you need to handle (jump over \ kill).
3. In this level we introduce the main concept of the game - multiple levels. In this level, we have a green door without a green key to open it. The player will need to go to the first level, get the key, and come back to the third level to finish it with this key.
